# Marksman

_Write Markdown with code assist and intelligence in the comfort of your favourite editor._

![splash](assets/readme/splash.png)

---

Marksman is a program that integrates with your editor to assist you in writing and maintaining your Markdown documents.
Using [LSP protocol][lsp-main] it provides **completion**, goto **definition**, find **references**, **rename**
refactoring, **diagnostics**, and more. In addition to regular Markdown, it also supports **wiki-link**-style references
that enable [Zettelkasten-like][zettel-wiki][^roam-research]<sup>,</sup> [^markdown-memo] note taking. See more about Marksman's
features below.

Marksman **works on MacOS, Linux, and Windows** and is distributed as a **self-contained binary** for each OS.

The server provides assistance with:

* Markdown inline links:
   ```md
   This is [inline link](/some-file.md#some-heading).
   This is an internal [anchor link](#heading).
   ```
* Markdown reference links:
   ```md
   See [reference].

   [reference]: /url "Title"
   ```
* Wiki-links:
   ```md
   Link to [[another-note]].
   Link to [[another-notes#heading]].
   Internal link to [[#a-heading]].
   ```

All types of links support completion, hover, goto definition/references. Additionally, Marksman provides diagnostics
for wiki-links to detect broken references and duplicate/ambiguous headings.

## Existing editor integrations[^lsp]:

* VSCode via [Marksman VSCode][mn-vscode].
* Neovim:
    * via [mason.nvim][mason-nvim] (automatic server installation) (requires [mason-lspconfig.nvim][mason-nvim-lsp-config])
    * via [nvim-lspconfig][nvim-marksman],
    * via [CoC-marksman][coc-marksman].
* Vim:
    * via [ale](ale) - will support Marksman out-of-the-box once [PR](https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale/pull/4565) is merged; in the meantime...

      Example config (add the following to your `~/.vim/after/ftplugin/markdown.vim`):

      ```viml
      if exists('g:loaded_ale')
        call ale#linter#Define('markdown', { 'name': 'marksman', 'lsp': 'stdio', 'executable': 'marksman', 'command': '%e server', 'initialization_options': {} })
      end
      ```

    * via [lsp](lsp)

      Example config (add the following to your `~/.vim/after/ftplugin/markdown.vim`):

      ```viml
      if exists('g:loaded_lsp')
        call LspAddServer([#{ name: 'marksman', filetype: ['markdown'], path: '/path/to/marksman', args: ['server'], syncInit: v:true }])
      end
      ```

* Emacs:
    * via [LSP Mode](https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/lsp-marksman/) (automatic server installation).

      Example config for `use-package` users:

      ```lisp
      (use-package markdown-mode
        :hook (markdown-mode . lsp)
        :config
        (require 'lsp-marksman))
      ```
    * via [Eglot][eglot], requires configuration (unless
      [eglot#1013][eglot-marksman-pr] gets merged); add the following to your
      `init.el`

      ```lisp
      (add-to-list 'eglot-server-programs '(markdown-mode . ("marksman")))
      (add-hook 'markdown-mode-hook #'eglot-ensure)
      ```
* [Helix](https://helix-editor.com/) supports Marksman out of the box. However, you need add `marksman` binary to
  your `PATH` manually.
* Sublime Text via [LSP-marksman][sublime-marksman] (automatic server
  installation).
* BBEdit [can be configured](https://github.com/artempyanykh/marksman/discussions/206#discussioncomment-5906423) to use Marksman as an LSP server for Markdown files.

## How to install

See the [installation instructions](/docs/install.md).

## Features

See [the Features page](/docs/features.md) to learn more about language features, configurations, and single- and multi-file modes.

## FAQ

* Cross-file references and completions don't work.
    + Either create an empty `.marksman.toml` in the root folder of your project or initialize a repository (e.g. `git init`). See [this page](/docs/features.md#workspace-folders-project-roots-and-single-file-mode) to learn more about single- and mult-file modes.
* I'm getting "marksman canâ€™t be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software" on MacOS.
    + Run the following command to bypass it and let Mac know that it's fine: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <path-to-marksman-bin>`.

[^roam-research]: You may have heard about [Roam Research][roam]. That is a commercial implementation of the
Zettelkasten method and another point of reference for what Marksman is about. However, unlike a proprietary Roam
Research, Marksman is free, open-source and integrated into your favourite editor (albeit for not not as feature rich as
Roam Research).

[^markdown-memo]: There is an excellent VSCode extension called [Markdown Memo][md-memo]. You definitely need
to check it out if you're primarily using VSCode as it has some features that are missing in Marksman and [Marksman
VSCode extension][mn-vscode]. However, Markdown Memo is VSCode specific while Marksman is a generic language server, so
can be used with any editor that has LSP support: Emacs, Vim, Neovim, etc.

[^lsp]: Since Marksman is a regular Language Server most of the functionality works out of the box
with any LSP client.

[^single-file-mode]: There is an initiative to add a single-file mode to
LSP but it's not a part of the spec at least until and including v3.17.
