# Can be either 'full' or `incremental`:
# * full: the whole copy of a document is sent by the editor
#   on every update,
# * incremental: only the changed parts are sent by
#   the editor. This will result in less trafic between
#   the editor and Marksman, but the overall performance
#   impact is marginal.

# sync which result in slightly correpted state and are really hard
# to diagnose.
