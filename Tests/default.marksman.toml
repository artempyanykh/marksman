[core]
markdown.file_extensions = ["md", "markdown"]
# Configures text sync protocol between the editor (LSP client)
# and Marksman (LSP server). 
# Can be either 'full' or `incremental`:
# * full: the whole copy of a document is sent by the editor
#   on every update,
# * incremental: only the changed parts are sent by
#   the editor. This will result in less trafic between
#   the editor and Marksman, but the overall performance
#   impact is marginal.
# Defaults to `full` because the editors have bugs in incremental
# sync which result in slightly correpted state and are really hard
# to diagnose.

# This is much more efficient but is currently experimental
