## Configuration

See [Configuration](/docs/configuration.md) docs for more details.

## Wiki links

Alongside regular markdown links, Marksman also supports wiki-style links, e.g. ``[[some-doc]]``
or ``[[#some-heading]]``. This is particularly convenient when working with a Zettelkasten-like repository of markdown
notes, as it streamlines linking and cross-linking of notes. This is what tool like [Obsidian][obsidian]
and [Emanote][emanote] use.

Documents can be referred either by their **title** or **filename**.
The exact behavior depends on the combination of settings.

### Titles from headings

Level 1 heading (`# Foo`) is treated as document's title.
This implies that there supposed to be at most one 'level 1 heading' in a document.

This is the default behavior. Users that don't want this behavior can change it in their
`.marksman.toml`:

```toml
[core]
title_from_heading = false
```

Note that setting `core.title_from_heading` to `false` automatically changes the default completion style to a
file-based one.
See [this config file](../Tests/default.marksman.toml) for more details.

### Completion style for wiki link

Wiki links can use both a title and a filename to reference a document.
The preferred style of completion is configured via `completion.wiki.style` configuration setting.

See [the example config file](../Tests/default.marksman.toml) for more details.

### Completion style and refactorings

Completion style is also used to resolve reference ambiguity.
For instance, let's take the following doc:

```md
// file:foo.md

# Foo

Bar
```

A wiki-link `[[foo]]` can either bind to the title `Foo` when the completion style is title-based, or to the filename
`foo.md` when completion style is file-based. Both point to the same document, but the effects of
refactorings will differ based on whether the link binds to the file or the title. For instance,

* when the preferred style is `title-slug`, renaming `foo.md` won't change `[[foo]]` because it's bound to the title,
  but renaming a title `# Foo` to `# Bar` will update `[[foo]]` to `[[bar]]`.
* when the preferred style is `file-stem`, the effect will be opposite to the above.

## Code actions

Code actions usually can be enabled/disabled via a configuration option. See
[configuration](#configuration) for more details.

### Table of Contents

Marksman has a code action to create and update a table of contents of a document.

## Ignore files

Marksman by default reads ignore globs from `.gitignore`, `.hgignore`, and
`.ignore` and doesn't scan directories matching any of the glob patterns.
Marksman will search for and read ignore files in all sub-folders of the
workspace. similarly to what Git does.

## Workspace folders, project roots, and single-file mode

The LSP specification is designed to work with projects rather than individual
files[^single-file-mode]. Marksman has a custom **single-file mode** that
provides a *subset* of language features for markdown files open outside of any
project. This works well for small one-off edits or when opening random
markdown files. However, when you have several interconnected documents do
consider setting up a project folder for them for an improved experience.

How a folder (aka project, aka root) is found varies between editors, but
usually it's either

1. a root of a VCS repository (applicable to all languages),
2. a folder with `.marksman.toml` marker file (specific to Marksman
   integrations).

When Marksman doesn't provide cross-file language assist for your files and you
don't understand why, you can either:

1. check your project into version control, or
2. create a `.marksman.toml` at the root folder of your project, or
3. refer to your editor/LSP client documentation regarding how a project root
   is defined.
